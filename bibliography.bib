	abstract = {Despite considerable community effort, there is no general set of equations to model long‐term landscape evolution. In order to determine a suitable set of landscape evolution process laws for a site where postglacial erosion has incised valleys up to 50{\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitildem deep, we generate a set of alternative models and perform a multi‐model analysis. The most basic model we consider includes stream‐power channel incision, uniform lithology, hillslope transport by linear diffusion, and surface‐water discharge proportional to drainage area. We systematically add one, two, or three elements of complexity to this model from one of four categories: hillslope processes, channel processes, surface hydrology, and representation of geologic materials. We apply methods of formal model analysis to the 37 alternative models. The global Method of Morris sensitivity analysis method is used to identify model input parameters that most and least strongly influence model outputs. Only a few parameters are identified as “important” and this finding is consistent across two alternative model outputs: one based on a collection of topographic metrics, and one that uses an objective function based on a topographic difference. Parameters that control channel erosion are consistently important, while hillslope diffusivity is important for only select model outputs. Uncertainty in initial and boundary conditions is associated with low sensitivity. Sensitivity analysis provides insight to model dynamics and is a critical step in using model analysis for mechanistic hypothesis testing in landscape evolution theory. Multiple landscape evolution models are developed for application in a well constrained site undergoing locally rapid (\${\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde4m/ka) erosion. Global sensitivity analysis reveals that uncertainty in initial and boundary conditions has low impact on model output metrics. Global sensitivity analysis finds that channel erosion parameters dominate and that select metrics are sensitive to hillslope diffusivity.},

We calibrate and validate a set of 37 landscape evolution models designed to hierarchically test elements of complexity from four categories: hillslope processes, channel processes, surface hydrology, and representation of geologic materials. Comparison of each model to a base model, which uses stream‐power channel incision, uniform lithology, hillslope transport by linear diffusion, and surface‐water discharge proportional to drainage area, serves as a formal test of which elements of complexity improve model performance. Model fit is assessed using an objective function based on a direct difference between observed and simulated modern topography. A hybrid optimization scheme identifies optimal parameters and uncertainty. Multi‐model analysis determines which elements of complexity improve simulation performance. Validation tests which model improvements persist when models are applied to an independent watershed. The three most important model elements are (1) spatial variation in lithology (differentiation between shale and glacial till), (2) a fluvial erosion threshold, and (3) a non‐linear relationship between slope and hillslope sediment flux. Due to nonlinear interactions between model elements, some process representations (e.g., non‐linear hillslopes) only become important when paired with the inclusion of other processes (e.g., erosion thresholds). This emphasizes the need for caution in identifying the minimally sufficient process set. Our approach provides a general framework for hypothesis testing in landscape evolution. Comparison of calibrated models at a well constrained field site serves as a formal hypothesis test of landscape evolution theory Representing subtle lithologic contrasts, fluvial incision thresholds, and nonlinear hillslope transport improve simulation results most Model structure improvements are not always linearly additive},

This work is motivated by a case study of sensitivity analysis, calibration, validation, multi‐model comparison, and prediction under uncertainty, which required bounding values for parameter ranges. Considered geomorphic transport formulae span hillslope sediment transport, soil production, and erosion by surface water. We compile or derive estimates for the parameters in these transport formulae. Additionally, we address a common challenge – connecting changes in precipitation distribution to changes in effective erodibility – by using a simple hydrologic model and a method to estimate precipitation distribution parameters using commonly available data. While some parameters are reasonably well constrained, others span orders of magnitude. Some, such as soil infiltration capacity, have a direct physical meaning but are challenging to measure on geologically relevant timescales. Through the process of compiling these ranges we identify common challenges in parameter determination. The issue of comparable units derives from considering an exponent as an empirically inferred coefficient rather than as an expression of a fundamental relationship. The issue of appropriate timescales derives from the mismatch between human‐measurement and geologic timescales. This contribution thus serves both a practical compilation for applications, and as a synthesis of outstanding challenges in parameter selection for geomorphic transport laws. We provide a compilation of parameter ranges for mature geomorphic transport laws in terrestrial geomorphology A simple hydrological model connects changes in the precipitation distribution with erodibility coefficients Common challenges include incomparable units and mismatch between observation and simulation timescales},

Our methods meet these functional requirements by providing three interactive computational narratives for hands-on, problem-based research demonstrating how to use Landlab on HydroShare. Landlab is an open-source toolkit for building, coupling, and exploring two-dimensional numerical models. HydroShare is an online collaborative environment for the sharing of data and models.

	abstract = {Slip distribution, slip rate, and slip per event for strike‐slip faults are commonly determined by correlating offset stream channels—under the assumption that they record seismic slip—but offset channels are formed by the interplay of tectonic and geomorphic processes. To constrain offset channel development under known tectonic and geomorphic conditions, we use numerical landscape evolution simulations along a theoretical strike‐slip fault with uniform and steady uplift, erosion, and diffusion. We investigate the influence of four tectonic parameters (fault zone width, earthquake recurrence interval, variance of the recurrence interval, and total slip relative to channel spacing) on offset channel development through multiple earthquake cycles. Analysis of {\textgreater}3,000 automatically measured offsets from {\textgreater}135 simulations suggests {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde30\% variability in individual measurements, but modeled displacement is recovered by averaging multiple measurements. However, the average of multiple offset measurements systematically underestimates modeled slip except when the fault zone is less than {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde5 m wide, total slip is less than channel spacing, and offsets are measured shortly after an earthquake. In these simulations, postearthquake landscape evolution widens the geomorphic expression of the fault zone and modifies apparent channel offsets. We distinguish this “geomorphic fault zone” from the tectonic fault zone (zone of coseismic distributed deformation). This study highlights the capability of landscape evolution models to explore a range of conditions not easily defined in natural examples and the importance of averaging multiple measurements. Our results verify that paleoseismic studies must consider how geomorphic change has modified offset markers and use caution interpreting slip histories with multiple earthquakes. We use landscape evolution simulations to investigate how geomorphic markers (e.g., stream channels) record displacement from earthquakes on strike‐slip faults. Stream channels offset across a fault are commonly used to determine the amount of displacement and slip rate of a fault, critical inputs to seismic hazard calculations. For example, Wallace Creek on the San Andreas Fault was famously calculated by Sieh and Jahns (1984, https://doi.org/10.1130/0016‐7606(1984)95{\textless}883:HAOTSA{\textgreater}2.0.CO;2) to be offset {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde128 m in {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde3,750 years ({\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde34 mm/year slip rate). However, actual displacement is rarely known, and displaced stream channels are created and modified by both tectonic processes, such as earthquakes, and geomorphic processes, such as erosion. We run landscape evolution simulations to characterize how offset channels develop under certain tectonic and geomorphic conditions. After an earthquake, the initially discrete channel offset is gradually smeared out and diminished. The results imply that offset stream channels accurately record modeled slip only when the zone of faulting is narrow, cumulative slip is less than the distance between stream channels, and offset distances are measured soon after an earthquake. Otherwise, average channel offset distances underestimate modeled slip, which indicates that slip rates and associated seismic hazard may be underestimated on real faults. Mean‐measured offset records modeled slip only if fault zone width is {\textless}5 m, total slip is less than channel spacing, and short time since earthquake Postearthquake landscape evolution widens the geomorphic fault zone and smears out initially discrete channel offsets Offset measurements have {\textbackslash}textbackslashtextasciitilde30\% natural variability, but modeled slip is recovered by taking the mean of multiple offset measurements},

	abstract = {The Chalk Cliffs debris-flow site is a small headwater catchment incised into highly fractured and hydrothermally altered quartz monzonite in a semiarid climate. Over half of the extremely steep basin is exposed bedrock. Debris flows occur multiple times per year in response to rainstorm events, typically during the summer monsoon season. The frequency of debris flows, and the uniformity of the underlying rock, make Chalk Cliffs an ideal study catchment for translating mechanistic understanding of natural debris flows to other sites. A 2008 National Center for Airborne Laser Mapping (NCALM) airborne lidar survey provides baseline topography for the site; however, heretofore there has been no systematic effort to collect repeat topography of the entire site. Starting in May 2018, we made repeat surveys of the basin with an unmanned aircraft system (UAS). The UAS-based imagery was processed into (x, y, z) point clouds using Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry. We georegistered the point clouds using 12 ground control points placed within and around the study basin. In this study we compare the lidar with one SfM point cloud to assess topographic change over a 10-year time period. The difference map provides observational data relevant to understanding sediment provenance and transport at the Chalk Cliffs. The difference image indicates erosion of colluvial surfaces, with limited deposition in the survey area. Some colluvial hillslopes show spatially uniform erosion while others experienced concentrated erosion of up to 3 m depth over a 10-year period.},

	volume = {10},
	doi = {10.5194/gmd-10-4577-2017},
	abstract = {Models of landscape evolution by river erosion are often either transport-limited (sediment is always available but may or may not be transportable) or detachment-limited (sediment must be detached from the bed but is then always transportable). While several models incorporate elements of, or transition between, transport-limited and detachment-limited behavior, most require that either sediment or bedrock, but not both, are eroded at any given time. Modeling landscape evolution over large spatial and temporal scales requires a model that can (1) transition freely between transport-limited and detachment-limited behavior, (2) simultaneously treat sediment transport and bedrock erosion, and (3) run in 2-D over large grids and be coupled with other surface process models. We present SPACE (stream power with alluvium conservation and entrainment) 1.0, a new model for simultaneous evolution of an alluvium layer and a bedrock bed based on conservation of sediment mass both on the bed and in the water column. The model treats sediment transport and bedrock erosion simultaneously, embracing the reality that many rivers (even those commonly defined as {\textless}q{\textgreater}bedrock{\textless}/q{\textgreater} rivers) flow over a partially alluviated bed. SPACE improves on previous models of bedrock\&ndash;alluvial rivers by explicitly calculating sediment erosion and deposition rather than relying on a flux-divergence (Exner) approach. The SPACE model is a component of the Landlab modeling toolkit, a Python-language library used to create models of Earth surface processes. Landlab allows efficient coupling between the SPACE model and components simulating basin hydrology, hillslope evolution, weathering, lithospheric flexure, and other surface processes. Here, we first derive the governing equations of the SPACE model from existing sediment transport and bedrock erosion formulations and explore the behavior of local analytical solutions for sediment flux and alluvium thickness. We derive steady-state analytical solutions for channel slope, alluvium thickness, and sediment flux, and show that SPACE matches predicted behavior in detachment-limited, transport-limited, and mixed conditions. We provide an example of landscape evolution modeling in which SPACE is coupled with hillslope diffusion, and demonstrate that SPACE provides an effective framework for simultaneously modeling 2-D sediment transport and bedrock erosion.},
